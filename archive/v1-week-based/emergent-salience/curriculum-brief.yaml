## Learner Profile
identity:
  anchors:
    - systems programming (strong)
    - linguistics (phonetics, phonology, grammar, semantics, pragmatics)
    - dataclasses, enums, Python typing
  learning_style: kinesthetic-visual
  learning_flow:
    - familiar anchor (linguistics metaphor)
    - code it (hands-on implementation)
    - visualize it (plots, animations)
    - formalize (math/theory last)
  failure_modes:
    - traditional 6-month ramp-ups (won't happen)
    - theory-first approaches (disengages)
    - lack of immediate application (falls off)
  strengths:
    - creative application once concepts click
    - teaching/explaining as consolidation
    - systems thinking (sees the architecture)
  neurodivergence:
    type: AuDHD
    implications:
      - needs fast dopamine hits
      - jump to interesting stuff immediately
      - escape hatches required
      - short sessions that build to hyperfocus

## Destination
outcomes:
  - "Can formalize intuitive rule systems as contextual bandits"
  - "Can implement Thompson Sampling with Beta posteriors"
  - "Can design constitutional constraint systems (safe RL)"
  - "Can measure learning dynamics via confidence velocity/acceleration"
  - "Can explain why this formalization generalizes naive approaches"
capstone:
  artifact: "buildlog-template emergent salience implementation"
  secondary: "arXiv-ready paper + publishable teaching content"
  income_goal: true
identity_shift: "I'm now the kind of person who can plan, write, and publish deep learning research seriously as a genuinely high-signal, rigorous member of the community."

## Terrain
perceived_gaps:
  - Beta distributions
  - Thompson Sampling
  - Contextual bandits / LinUCB
  - Regret bounds and proofs
actual_gaps:
  - Same as perceived (good self-awareness)
  - Plus: cosine similarity refresh
transfer_from:
  phonetics_phonology:
    - articulation → rule mechanics
    - allophonic variation → context-dependent selection
    - phonotactics → constitutional constraints
    - prosody → salience/emphasis
  grammar:
    - syntax → rule structure
    - morphology → rule composition
    - grammaticalization → rule emergence
  semantics:
    - meaning as geometry → embeddings
    - semantic fields → k-NN neighborhoods
    - polysemy → context-dependent interpretation
  pragmatics:
    - appropriateness → context-aware selection
    - implicature → what's unsaid but inferred
emotional_blockers:
  - "all of it is unfamiliar" (but not paralyzing)
  - proofs feel like a doozy (defer, don't avoid)

## Constraints
time:
  hours_per_week: 3.5  # 30 min/day × 7
  total_weeks: 5-6
  session_length: 20-45 min
  session_type: short bursts → hyperfocus once habit forms
  best_time: variable
environment:
  hardware: sufficient (GPU if needed)
  stack: Python, torch, numpy, matplotlib (ready)
  project: buildlog-template (target implementation)
accountability:
  primary: intrinsic intellectual drive
  secondary: shipping public artifacts for income/brand
  external: none required
non_negotiables:
  must_include:
    - hands-on code every session
    - visualization of every concept
    - clear path to publishable artifacts
    - linguistics anchors for new concepts
  must_avoid:
    - theory-first modules
    - "6 months of foundations"
    - unmarked rabbit holes (time traps)

## Arc
shape: capstone-driven + spiral
theory_practice_ratio: 20/80
capstone_driven: true
spiral_revisits:
  - Beta distributions (intro → Thompson Sampling → learning dynamics)
  - Embeddings (refresh → centrality → LinUCB context)
  - Regret (intuition → bounds → optional proof)
escape_hatches: true
optional_depth: true (marked "[OPTIONAL DEPTH]")
dopamine_strategy:
  - working code in first 10 minutes of each notebook
  - "you just implemented X" celebration moments
  - visible progress toward buildlog implementation
  - linguistics "aha" connections throughout
stuck_protocol:
  1: novelty reset (switch to adjacent topic)
  2: return later (mark and move on)
  3: grind (only if 1 and 2 fail)
win_condition: "write a notebook section, pass brutal professor review"
