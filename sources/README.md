# Sources & Reading List

Curated resources for deep dives beyond the notebooks.

## How to Use This

- **During curriculum**: Primers and notebooks are self-contained. Only dive into sources if curious.
- **Going deeper**: Each source is tagged with which week/topic it supports.
- **Research mode**: Papers and advanced books for Week 9-10 experiments.
