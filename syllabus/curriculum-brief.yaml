# Unified Curriculum Brief — Aegir
# Replaces: syllabus/emergent-salience/curriculum-brief.yaml (v1)

learner:
  name: Peleke
  background:
    - Senior software engineer (full-stack, systems)
    - Building buildlog — agent learning infrastructure with Thompson Sampling bandits
    - AuDHD — needs novelty/challenge hooks to fire the start engine; hyperfocus is a superpower when engaged
    - Strong programming intuition, weaker formal math foundations
    - Learns best by building first, reading theory second
  strengths:
    - Implementation speed
    - Systems thinking
    - Writing for technical audiences
    - Pattern recognition across domains
  gaps:
    - Formal probability and statistics (filling via Arc 0)
    - Linear algebra fluency (filling via Arc 1)
    - Bayesian modeling beyond conjugate priors (filling via Arc 2)
    - Differential geometry and information geometry (filling via Arc 3)
    - LLM internals and architecture (filling via companion Arc LLM)

destination:
  technical:
    - Design and run statistically rigorous experiments for agent learning systems
    - Implement contextual bandits (LinUCB) and hierarchical Bayesian models
    - Read and implement papers in geometric deep learning and information geometry
    - Write production Haskell for physics simulations
  publication:
    - Maintain a tutorial series on experimental design for AI agent systems
    - Publish technical pieces that reach HN front page and practitioner audiences
    - Produce conference-track material on information geometry of rule learning (Arc 3-4)
  product:
    - Ship buildlog with rigorous statistical infrastructure (engine/statistics.py, engine/trials.py)
    - Extend Agno BanditStore or buildlog hierarchical model with contextual features

constraints:
  - Arcs are completion-gated, not time-gated
  - Every arc must produce at least 2 publishable artifacts
  - Implementation targets must be real shipped code, not toy exercises
  - AuDHD accommodations: short motivation hooks, visual maps, optional depth rabbit holes
  - No week numbers — progress is measured by what you can do, not calendar time
